##Project

Together we will create a collaborative mood board. Today we'll focus on object oriented programming and working on animating our own emotions leading up to a live site hosting our collaborative work. 

The best part of this will be hosting all of this on a git repo so that we will be able to see how everyone made their piece / anyone in the creative code community will be able to see our work.
